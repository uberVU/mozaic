        ###
            This class contains all data channel interaction code from
            mozaic widgets. A channel is basically a Backbone collection
            that is managed by the Mozaic datasource.

            ###

            # from the controller.

        modifyChannel: (channel, dict, options = {}) ->
            ###
                Request a modification of a certain data channel.
                If new_value is true, the sent value is the new value
                of the parameters for the data channel (e.g., internal
                parameters are reset).

                @param {String} channel
                @param {Object} dict
                @param {Object} options
                @param {String} [options.update_mode = 'append']
                                    Appends the parameters to existing ones
                                    (possibly overwriting them)
                @param {String} [options.update_mode = 'reset']
                                    Makes these the actual parameters
                                    (and updates the old values)
                @param {String} [options.update_mode = 'exclude']
                                    Excludes these parameters
                                    (deletes them from the current parameters)
                @param {Boolean} [options.already_translated]
                                    The channel is already in GUID form, don't
                                    bother to translate it
                @param {Boolean} [options.sync]
                                    Decides whether a server sync should be done (POST/PUT),
                                    or only a local update of the backbone model. Note:
                                    the local model update is also done if sync = true,
                                    but *AFTER* the server response has come back.
                @param {Boolean} [options.silent]
                                    Decides whether the local backbone model update (which
                                    is done regardless of the sync flag) should be done
                                    silently or not.
                @param {Object} [options.filter]
                                    A collection of filters to select which objects from
                                    collection will be updated

                How to use this:
                @modifyChannel('/mention/123', {title: 'new title'})
                @modifyChannel('/mentions_count', {count: 123})

                Request a refresh of certain data channels to which this widget is subscribed.
                Note! This method will not work for channels the widget is not subscribed to!

                The method of the widget corresponding to the channel will be called
                back whenever the data is available.

        subscribeToChannel: (channel, type, params) =>
            ###
                Subscribes the current widget to a new channel. There are
                2 main use-cases here:

                1) conditionally decide whether to subscribe to notifications
                   to a channel that is passed on inject

                   @subscribeToChannel('/social_profiles')

                2) create a new channel and subscribe to it immediately.

                   @subscribeToChannel('/social_profiles_for_posting',
                                       '/social_profiles',
                                       {'parent_id': 1234})

                For the second use-case, note that the local alias of the
                widget might be different from the channel type name as defined
                in datasource.js (social_profiles_for_posting vs.
                social_profiles).
