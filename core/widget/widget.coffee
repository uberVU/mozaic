        ###
            The widget is the building block of UIs in mozaic.js ie. interfaces
            are built by composing widgets that encapsulate functionality.

            The following is a centralized list of the properties supported
            by the widget class and their use-cases:

            @property {String} @template_name - path to widget's template, it's
                                    relative to the root of the application.
            @property {Object} @template - internal instance of a Handlebars
                                    object with compiled templates.
            @property {Number} @constructed_at - unix timestamp for the date
                                         when the widget constructor was run.

            @property {Object} @params - hash of parameters passed by parent
                                         widget upon injection into the DOM.
            @property {Object} @params_defaults - Specifies default values for
                    the widget @params. The format is `{key:value}`.
                    All specified keys are attached to the instance.
                    If `value` is a function then @key gets it's return value.
                        Note that these functions get executed in the context
                        of the widget after all other defaults have been set,
                        including the values set in @params, this means you can
                        modify the received value dynamically.
                    If `value` is `data-params` then @key gets the value from
                        the passed @params[key] object.
                    Otherwise, @key receives whatever `value` is passed in @params
            @property {Object} @params_required - an array of parameters
                                expected in @params from the injector widget.

            @property {Object} @elements - a hash `{'name':'selector'}`
                    This hash is processed after widget renders and sets
                    `@['name']` to be a jQuery element inside the widget
                    that matches `'selector'`
            @property {Object} @events - a hash with the following signature:
                    `{'event @element': 'functionName'} or
                    `{'event selector': 'functionName'}
                    It maps an `event` on a previously computed `@element` or
                    on every element that matches the `selector`, to a
                    `functionName` of the current object that acts as a
                    handler of that event.
                    NOTE! You might want to bind the handler function to the
                    current instance, otherwise the application.

            CHANNELS
            @property {Array} @subscribed_channels - list of channel types the
                                    widget is bound to. Whenever events are
                                    published on one of the channels defined
                                    here, a method named @get_<channel_name>()
                                    gets executed. Child widgets must implement
                                    these methods in order to get updates from
                                    the channel.
            @property {Object} @aggregated_channels - a list of channel types
                                    bound to a method name which allows the
                                    widget to access data from multiple channels
                                    at once.
            @property {Object} @aggregator - internal, holds data from the
                                    latest events of all channels the widget is
                                    bound to.
            @property {Array} @loading_channels -list of channels types whose
                                    aggregated events determine the widget's
                                    transition to a certain new state
            @property {Object} @channel_mapping - this is an internal hash that
                                    maps channel types from @subscribed_channels
                                    to the actual instances of the channel.
            @property {Boolean} @URGENT_FOR_GC

            STATES
            @property {String} @initial_state - internal, holds the name of the
                                initial state. NOTE that this is called 'init'.
            @property {Array} @loadingStates - internal, holds a list of states
                                for all aggregated channels. The possible states
                                supported by a channel are 'init', 'empty',
                                'incompatible', 'available'.
                                @see WidgetStatesMixin#changeState
            @property {String} @data_state -
            @property {Boolean} @STRICT_CHANGE_STATE

            RENDERING
            @property {Object} @view - instance of Backbone.View
            @property {Object} @el - intance of jQuery, @deprecated
            @property {Boolean} @isDetachedFromDOM - flag indicating if the
                                    widget is not in the DOM anymore.
            @property {Object} @saved_view - instance of Backbone.View, relevant
                                    for detached widgets, ie. widgets that are
                                    no longer in the DOM.
            @property {Object} @saved_el - instance of jQuery, again only
                                    relevant for detached widgets.
            @property {Object} @pre_render - hash of context processors to be
                                    executed _before_ the widget is rendered.
                                    A context processor is a function that
                                    modifies the behaviour or presentation of
                                    the widget in some way.
                                    NOTE that context processors need to be
                                    registered globally in
                                    ubvu_application_controller before usage.
            @property {Object} @post_render - hash of context processors with
                                    their parameters to be executed after the
                                    widget has rendered. Examples: tooltip,
                                    tinyscrollbar.
            @property {Object} @layout - instance of core/layout class.

            @property {Object} @profiler - instance of YUIProfiler class. Does
                                    what it says on the tin! it's a class and
                                    function profiler.
            @property {Boolean} @rendered_signal_sent - flag sent right after
                                    publishing `/new_widget_rendered`.
        ###

        ###
            /new_widget_rendered can be sent only once per widget instance.
            It is sent in one of two cases:

            1) if the widget has no template_name, it most probably means
               that it's a proxy widget, so it will send this signal on
               initialize. loading_animation will then keep waiting after
               its children. If it has no children, it must be an utility
               widget, so either way it doesn't make sens to wait for it
               to render.

            2) if the widget has a template_name, it will send a signal
               on the first un-silenced renderLayout. Most (99%) of renderLayout
               calls are un-silenced, but sometimes we want to make sure when
               the page finishes loading, we see a certain content (aka the
               full content), while when we navigate from page to page it's
               acceptable to see smaller loading animations.
        ###
        rendered_signal_sent: false

        ###
            Initial state of the widget. It is toggled by default when
            the widget starts.

            Set it to any of the supported states to start the widget
            in a particular state.

            Override the default state using the data-param _initial_state_
            property.

        # Set this to true to only trigger changeState() whenever there is
        # a transition from an old state to a different new state (a transition

                Every time a new widget is instatiated, publish a request to `new_widget`
                In this request, also send the channels the widget will be subscribed to
