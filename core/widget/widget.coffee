            /new_widget_rendered can be sent only once per widget instance.
            It is sent in one of two cases:

            1) if the widget has no template_name, it most probably means
               that it's a proxy widget, so it will send this signal on
               initialize. loading_animation will then keep waiting after
               its children. If it has no children, it must be an utility
               widget, so either way it doesn't make sens to wait for it
               to render.

            2) if the widget has a template_name, it will send a signal
               on the first un-silenced renderLayout. Most (99%) of renderLayout
               calls are un-silenced, but sometimes we want to make sure when
               the page finishes loading, we see a certain content (aka the
               full content), while when we navigate from page to page it's
               acceptable to see smaller loading animations.

            Initial state of the widget. It is toggled by default when
            the widget starts.

            Set it to any of the supported states to start the widget
            in a particular state.

            Override the default state using the data-param _initial_state_
            property.
