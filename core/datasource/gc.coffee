            Includes a method for garbage collect channels when they
            are no longer used
        ###

        channelCanBeGarbageCollected: (channel) ->
            ###
                Checks if a Datasource channel can be safely garbage collected.

                There are several factors which can influence this:

                - the channel has waiting fetches (aka, we have launched
                  a request to fetch data, and that request will have nowhere
                  to add the data to)

                - the channel hasn't had reference_count 0 for enough time
                  (having a channel lurking around for a little while with
                  data in it is useful when changing from one controller to
                  another - the same channels from the new controller will
                  be cloned from the old ones)

                - the channel is eternal (this is useful if you have info
                  that is displayed on absolutely all pages and don't want
                  it to ever be garbage collection); this should be used
                  in conjunction with application_controller which should
                  be careful to create those eternal channels and pass them
                  on correctly.
            ###
            meta = @meta_data[channel]
            reference = @reference_data[channel]

            # Eternal channels are never expired

        garbageCollectChannel: (channel) ->
            ###
                Garbage collect a channel after we detect that it's of no use
                to anyone else.
            ####
            # Declare that channel has expired loudly and openly.
            logger.info("Garbage collecting channel #{channel} in DataSource.")
            delete @reference_data[channel]
            # The meta_data might not have even been created if a channel got
            # removed before its collection loaded
            return unless @meta_data[channel]?
            # Stop periodic refresh if it was enabled

        checkForUnusedChannels: ->
            ###
                This function gets cleaned up periodically in order to
                inspect which channels still have a non-zero reference count
                and which don't.

                Those who have been inactive (e.g., 0 reference count) for
                quite a while (> checkIntervalForUnusedChannels) will be
                garbage colllected, unless they are eternal.

                Some collections might be eternal, and this is a per-channel
                flag (so not found in datasource.js, but passed to
                Utils.newDataChannels when creating channel instances) because
                for example they are created from the application controller
                and they should live for the whole navigation session regardless
                of whether what is found on the page actually references them
                or not.

          ###
              Given a newly-appeared widget, increase reference counts for
              channels it references via channel_mapping (the mapping from
              the channels the widget needs to actual channel IDs from the
              Datasource).

                Given a freshly-garbage-collected widget, decrease the reference
                counts of the channels used by the widget (found in
                widget.channel_mapping). When a channel's reference count
                reaches 0, it will be garbage collected itself (see
                @checkForUnusedChannels).

            ###
                Unbinds a widget from all of its related backbone events
                (be it collection-level events or model-level events),
                for classical Backbone collections or for our own RawData.

                The datasource is responsible for this because it's also
                responsible for binding the widget to channel events.
