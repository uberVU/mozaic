            ###
                Split a channel name into the 3 components: collection, id, events

                Widgets can declare interest in a channel of the form:
                /collection_name/id/events

                * collection_name is mandatory, and is the name of
                    the followed entities (e.g., mentions)
                * id is the ID of the entity followed, or "all" (optional)
                    - /mentions_guid/234 will declare interest in mention with id 234
                    - /mentions_guid/all will declare interest in all mentions
                    If "id" is missing, it is assumed to be "all"
                * events is the type of events to be monitored
                    - "all" for all events
                    - "add/remove/reset/change/etc." for a specific event

        createGlobalChannel: (alias, params, type) ->
            ###
               Creates a global channel of the given type with the given params
               under the given alias. Global channels will have the "eternal"
               flag on - a.k.a. they will never be garbage collected even though
               there are no widgets subscribed to them.

               The channel_alias -> channel_id mapping should be stored
               in the Mozaic global object.

               The result of the function is the channel id of the newly created
               channel because we might need to use it right away.

               @param{string} alias - name under which the global channel will
                                      be known from now on
               @param{Object} params - parameters for the channel initialization
                                       (defaults to empty dict)
               @param{string} type - the type of channel (e.g. /social_profiles).
                                     Defaults to the alias in order to encourage
                                     intuitive naming of global aliases.

               @return{string} - the globally unique ID of the channel, if we
                                 managed to create it, or null, if something went
                                 wrong.
