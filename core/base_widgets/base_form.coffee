                This method will trigger commit when the user hits `enter`.
                To achive this, we listen for all `keypress` events, filter
                only `Enters` and make sure the focus is not on a textarea,
                as this will result in a horrible experience.
                @param {Object} event - instance of jQuery.Event

            return unless event.which is ENTER

            $elem = ($ document.activeElement)
            return if ($elem.is 'textarea') or
                $elem.attr('contenteditable') is 'true'

            event.stopPropagation()
            event.preventDefault()

            @commit()
