                If you're concerned with the type of update, you should

                black list unwanted local attributes.
                For example we set a folders attribute on a stream
                and that doesn't map to any server attributes, so
                we shouldn't send it.

                Iterate over the unsyncable attributes and unset their
                values before sending the request to the server and
                then set them back once the operation is done.

            # 3. model.save({key: value,...}, options)
            # @see http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html
            # In the third case, `value` param is in fact the options hash,
            # so to overwrite save() we need to check for this case.

                Overwrite the destroy method to provide an easy hook
                for models to execute code after the model is successfully
                deleted.
