###

  Widget starter is the Mozaic component managing the relationship
  between in-memory widgets and the DOM. In principle, it listens to
  changes of the DOM (widgets added/removed) and reacts intelligently to them.
  I will denote these two types of processes by the terms "spawn" and "GC".

  Changes to the DOM are detected through the preferred method available
  on the client's browser. The faster, the more preferred :)
  In the order of preference, the methods we use are:
  - mutation observers
  - DOM mutation events
  - polling (for those browsers written in Redmond :P)

                Marks a DOM element containing a widget (can be either

                This has two consequences: first, the widget is put into a
                garbage collection queue which will eventually garbage collect
                all their internal references and also unbind them from events.
                But this is an expensive operation and we need an easy way out
                until we stop receiving events (a detached widget will not
                receive any DOM events but only data events). Therefore,
                the second consequence is the setting of a flag for that widget
                which will immediately cause it to start ignoring data events.
