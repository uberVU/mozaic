                This method injects a TODO widget into the DOM.
                The widget needs to know the /todos channel in order
                to listen to changes for an individual TODO item.

                This method is called to reset the graphical representation of
                the todos from scratch (because the collection itself has
                been reset from scratch).

            ###
                This method is called to add a new model to the graphical
                representation of the todos, whenever the collection
                notifies the widget that a new element has been added.

            ###
                This method will be called whenever there are changes
                to the /todos channel. Changes can be of multiple types,
                as this data channel is actually a Backbone Collection.
                (There is another type of channel as well, which can store raw
                JSON data).
